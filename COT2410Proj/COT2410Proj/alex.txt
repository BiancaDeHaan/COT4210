Hello, there.  A pleasure to meet you, I am Alex Hughes, an old friend of the owner of this manor.  And you are?

Great to meet you, inspector! I hope I can help you find who did this.

you last night
Why, being perfectly honest I can hardly remember. I was the first one here, and the first one to reach the drinks!  I don’t get out often, but when I do I make sure to take advantage of the chance.  I do remember having some amazing conversations, however.

I chatted with Ben for a while after everyone had left.  Maybe it was just the drinks, but he was definitely having an off night.

you nervous
It’s not every day you’re a part of a murder mystery, my friend.  Who wouldn’t be nervous?  What if I’m next?  What if you’re the murderer? It’s hard to be relaxed in a situation like this.  Aren’t you nervous?  Someone here is a murderer!

im not nervous
Nerves of steel!  I guess that comes with your job, though

i'm not nervous

That’s good!  Looks like you’re human too!

what brings you here
Old Ben and I go way back. We’ve known each other since middle school, and we’ve had some sort of competition between us running almost every day since then!  \nHe’s always been one step ahead, though.  He’s been an inch taller than me our whole lives!  Never bothered me much, though.\nWe haven’t caught up in a good while, so this get-together was the perfect chance for a reunion.

competition
Ah yep, we’ve always competed over every little thing.  Girls, cars, boats, houses.  I’ve been at his heels for as long as I can remember.  I like to think it’s kept me humble, despite my successes.  I think he might’ve taken it a bit further than he even wanted to at dessert last night, though.

dessert
Well, this is kind of embarrassing, but I guess it’s probably important.  I baked cakes for everyone on the guest list for the party last night.  I’m a bigger guy, and I love cake, so I made my cake a bit bigger.  When they were passed around for dessert, I think Ben got a bit upset that mine was bigger.  He scarfed his dessert down in a heartbeat, and then he took poor Mae’s cake and ate that too!  He must’ve been having a really rough day, I haven’t seen him act like that since high school.  He did apologize to me later, but it was really rude to his wife

later
I stayed for a while after dessert to catch up with Ben over drinks.  He said he’d just been stressed out at work lately, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.  My driver took me home maybe an hour or two after everyone else left.

reunion
I mean, It’s been a year since all of this COVID stuff started up.  I haven’t seen anyone in a while!

your job
I own Hughe Boats, one of the top Yacht manufacturers out there.  Doesn’t turn quite as much of a profit as Fairsley Pharma, but I’m you could say I’m not exactly struggling for cash!

your freetime
Mostly crabbing!  I also like to read classic novels and practice small things, like baking. I’ve been told my baking is top-notch!  Not much else to do during this lockdown, so I’ve had practice.

where were you
I was at the party!  I stayed around for a little while after dessert to catch up with Ben some more over some drinks.  After all the damage he did to those cakes, I figure he needed someone to talk to.

did you do it
An old man like me has nothing to gain from doing something like that. Besides, Ben was a friend.  I’ve lived my life, had my joy, why not give everyone else a chance to live theirs as well? Besides, doing something like that would risk whatever time I have left!
