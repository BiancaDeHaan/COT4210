hi
Wow, they really did a number on this place last night.

who are you 
Evelyn Garcia, the maid of the deceased. I come here every Saturday to clean, but I mostly stay out of the way of Mr. Fairsley and keep to myself.

Mr. Sinclair didn’t want me there during the party, only before.

you nervous
It’s too stuffy in this room, and I’m being accused of murder. The heat is bad for my complexion. If someone in this room really is a cold-blooded murderer, I’d look at whoever’s sweating the least.

what brings you here
I come here for my job and for my pay- and nothing else. I have no personal relations for the deceased. I simply clean the house.

your job
I thought it was obvious, I’m a maid. I clean.

what do you do for a living
I clean for a living. What? Is that too beneath you? It’s honest work, it pays well, and I am treated fairly, for the most part. I stay out of the way, and I never cause any problems around the neighborhood.

what you think victim
We had our disagreements, but Mr. Fairsley was a strong-willed, hard-working man.  I feel sorry for his poor wife in all of this.

disagreements
Let’s say we’ve grown apart over the years.  It’s foolish, but I stick around mostly for Mrs. Fairsley nowadays.

your free time
I enjoy watching television, I have no family and no one around me, so I interest myself in the lives of others on drama television shows. What’s with that look? As if you’re doing anything more meaningful.

what think of alex
He and Mr. Fairsley are really old friends.  The man is a bit of a doormat, though.  I saw him on my way out when I left yesterday.

Mae Fairsley is a saint, she was probably delivering a baby at the hospital or giving a puppy CPR last night.

who did this
Now that I think of it, that watch had someone’s initials on it.  Was there anyone at the party with initials like that?

watch
Ugh, alright.  Fairsley’s a son of a bitch.  Was.  \nHe treated his wife like trash, and I’ve cleaned up after his extra-marital exploits more than once.  \nHe’d been getting more and more irritable lately, so I started bringing my two weeks’ notice in my bags a few weeks back.  \nYesterday, I gave him one last chance.  He wanted me to come in early to clean up before the party.  I scrubbed the toilets, polished the trophies, the usual. \nThen I found his “friend’s” watch in the bedsheets.  I normally mind my own business with clients, but this was a different case.  \nIf Mrs. Fairsley found that herself it would’ve nearly killed her.  \nI threw it into the nightstand and marched to his office to put in my two weeks’ notice.  \nHe tore it in half, screaming about how I know too much about his personal life to quit, and how if I’ll “never work in this town again” if I quit now.    \nOriginally, I was supposed to come back last night after the party and clean up, but I was furious. \nI left before the party started and never planned on coming back.  \nThen, you guys called me.  Honestly, I’m mad I didn’t get to do him in myself

friend
If he was able to take that secret to the grave, I figured I should leave it there.  It’s not like I ever saw this “friend” in person or knew their name, and Mrs. Fairsley doesn’t deserve the stress.

why did you quit
You found my letter of resignation? I hate it here. That's why I quit.
