hi
Wow, they really did a number on this place last night.

Evelyn Garcia, the maid of the deceased. I come here every Saturday to clean, but I mostly stay out of the way of Mr. Fairsley and keep to myself.

you nervous
It’s too stuffy in this room, and I’m being accused of murder. The heat is bad for my complexion. If someone in this room really is a cold-blooded murderer, I’d look at whoever’s sweating the least.

what brings you here
I come here for my job and for my pay- and nothing else. I have no personal relations for the deceased. I simply clean the house.

I thought it was obvious, I’m a maid. I clean.

what do you do for a living
I clean for a living. What? Is that too beneath you? It’s honest work, it pays well, and I am treated fairly, for the most part. I stay out of the way, and I never cause any problems around the neighborhood.

what do you think of victim
We had our disagreements, but Mr. Fairsley was a strong-willed, hard-working man.  I feel sorry for his poor wife in all of this.

disagreements
Let’s say we’ve grown apart over the years.  It’s foolish, but I stick around mostly for Mrs. Fairsley nowadays.

your free time
I enjoy watching television, I have no family and no one around me, so I interest myself in the lives of others on drama television shows. What’s with that look? As if you’re doing anything more meaningful.

He and Mr. Fairsley are really old friends.  The man is a bit of a doormat, though.  I saw him on my way out when I left yesterday.

The Mars guy?  I’m surprised his name is even on the radar, here.  He landed a robot on Mars by himself, how does that even relate to pharma?

Mae Fairsley is a saint, she was probably delivering a baby at the hospital or giving a puppy CPR last night.
